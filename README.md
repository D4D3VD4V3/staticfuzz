# staticfuzz

I have ten memories of anonymous people.

If I make a new memory, I forget the eleventh oldest.

In the future the demo (currently hosted at
http://lilylemmer.pythonanywhere.com/) will be
available via http://staticfuzz.com/.

## Running

  1. `pip install -r requirements.txt`
  2. `sqlite3 staticfuzz.db < schema.sql`
  3. `python main.py`

God is `lain` and password is `bear`.

Checkout `config.py`.
