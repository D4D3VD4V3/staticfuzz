# STATICFUZZ

http://staticfuzz.com:5000/

Image board of ten anonymous memories.

Every new memory makes the oldest vanish forever.

## Why use?

  * Efficient: asynchronous, server sent event (SEE/EventSource)
  * Easy to configure: `config.py`
  * Great notification system

## Running

  1. `pip install -r requirements.txt`
  2. `python staticfuzz.py initdb`
  2. `python staticfuzz.py serve`

Then you open http://localhost:5000/ in a web browser.

God is `lain` and password is `bear`.
